<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">Abstract</span></h3>
Video game development have come a long way in terms of incorporating logical reasoning and decision making for Non Player Characters (NPC) either as an individual or a group working together towards a common goal. Planning is a key ability for intelligent agents when working in a group, increasing their autonomy and flexibility through the construction of sequences of actions to achieve their goals. It has been an area of research since the earliest days of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive science. This paper will explore the concepts of Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning algorithm and how it can be effectively used to perform real‐time planning among a group of NPC&rsquo;s in a stealth‐based game.

<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">About the prototype</span></h3>
Th objective is to reach safely to the top-left corner without being seen by any of the rotating sonars that can detect AI entities labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4, only when they are in motion and sonars are facing towards them.</td>

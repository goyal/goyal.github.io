<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">About the Game</span></h3>
Fattie's Butterfly Hunt was created as part of a 48 hour Design Jam at the Center for Digital Media. Our task was to create a working game within the 48 hour time limit considering the theme, "I dreamed a thousand new paths, I woke and walked my old one" and using at least one "pallindrome, serrated and plump".
<br /><br /> The game involve total five levels and the objective is to collect 50 butterflies in 40 seconds. The rare pink butterfly, if picked, will give an extra 10 seconds.
<br /><br /> Duration: 2 Days
<br /> Team Size: 3

<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">My Role &amp; Responsibility</span></h3>
As a team member, I
<ul>
<li>was involved in game design discussions.</li>
<li>served as a lead gameplay programmer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">Achievement</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>This was the first time I particiapted in the 48 hour design jam. I learnt how to scope things correctly and keep them simple, so that they can be easily achieved within the specified time limit without compromising quality. I also learned, how important it is to have something running on the screen as soon as possible.</li>
<li>It was my first encounter with actionscript 2 in such detail and it helped me to kickstart and apply my game programming skills in actionscript too.</li>
<li>Successfully completed the game in 48 hours.</li>

<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">My Role &amp; Responsibility</span></h3>
Served as a lead gameplay programmer spending most of my time programming in C# and XNA 4.0. In addition to that, I also took active participation in game design discussions and several brainstorming sessions.<br /> Total lines of code written: 2700
<h3><span style="color: #5a8fc0;">Achievements</span></h3>
<p>This project was achieved in 3 weeks by working during weekends and in our own leisure time. This project not only gave us the opportunity to learn about a new development platform (Windows Phone 7) which was about to release to the market but also provide us a golden opportunity to complete the game and make it available for Windows Phone 7 launch via zune marketplace. This project is a proven great success for our team.</p>
